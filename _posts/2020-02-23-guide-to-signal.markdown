Earlier this year I was tasked to help in rewriting an Indonesian-made chat app, that project make me curious about chatting app, is there an open-source chat app that has a guaranted security?  <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is one that I found that not only easy to setup our own private server, but also has a great community support. During the process of learning how to deploy our own Signal Server, I saw a lack of comperhensive guide, that's why I decided to wrote a guide by compiling the guide from the community and adding my own solution to the problems i stumbled upon.
